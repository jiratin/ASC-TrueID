## Overview Architecture
**MVVM** is cleanly separates presentation layer from the other layers. Divorcing one from the other improves its maintainability and testability. It also makes the application evolution easier in the future, thereby reducing the risk of technological obsolescence. 

Eliminates the need for application redesign user interfaces become outdated, or even add more complexity in the specific layer.
For example, adding local data source to the application could be impacts to the other layers.

Please note that every view model in this project will be named as **screen view model**, e.g. `AmityFeedScreenViewModel` and `AmityRecentChatScreenViewModel`.

## Installation

### For latest UIKit releases `> 2.35.0`

AmityUIKit links with other dependencies such as `AmitySDK`, `Realm`, `RealmSwift` etc through `SharedFrameworks` which is a Swift Package.When you clone the project for the first time, all of this should be already setup for you. 

To run sample app:
- Simply build `AmityUIKit` target & then build `SampleApp` target and you would be able to run the sample project.

If you encounter any issues, you can 

- Reset `Sample App` project package cache. 
- Make sure `SharedFrameworks` and `AmityUIKit.framework` is linked in Sample App.

If you want to integrate this open sourced codebase to your existing project, please follow the installation steps provided in our documentation. [Installation Steps](https://docs.amity.co/uikit/ios/ios-uikit-installation-guide#_bln34rs78cz) 


### For older UIKit releases `< 2.35.0`:

As our older version of UIKit depends upon git lfs, please run the following command before building framework or running sample app.

```
git lfs fetch
```

Then, run the following command.
```
git lfs pull
```

<br />

AmityUIKit supports building xcframework which can be used on any Xcode version. Please follow this instruction for building.
1. In terminal, go to project directory
2. Run "./scripts/release-uikit.sh"
